# Space_Couriers_2
The new repo for Space Couriers. 

In Space Couriers, you and your friends will team up to keep a rickety spaceship up and running while it travels the galaxy, delivering packages. 
Repair malfunctioning equipment, upgrade your ship, fend off alien invasions, and profit from asteriod extraction. In this Among-Us & Overcooked cross over, the only way to ensure the package makes it safely is by keeping everything running... all at once.

Main features include coop gameplay with tasks for that require both single-player concentration and teamwork.
